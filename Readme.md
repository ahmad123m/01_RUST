## Variables, Data types, Functions, Control Flow, Ownership and References

My personal notes and study material.

This repo currently contains some key points and examples from:

- [Variables](variables/src/bin/)
- [Data_types](data_types/src/bin/)
- [Functions](functions/src/bin/)
- [Control_Flow](control_flow/src/bin/)
- [Exercise](exercise/src/bin/)
- [Ownership](ownership/src/bin/) and [References](ownership/src/bin/references.rs)
- [Structs](structs/src/bin/)

[01_RUST](https://github.com/ahmad123m/01_RUST) is being updated

Thanks to the [Rust_Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)
