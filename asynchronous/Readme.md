- Future: A value that might not be ready yet; async fn returns a Future.
- async/await: Makes async code look synchronous; .await drives a future to completion.
- Concurrency: Running multiple futures together without blocking.
- Stream: An async iterator; yields values over time.
- Executor: A runtime (like Tokio/async-std) that polls futures and runs tasks.
- Tasks: Lightweight async units of work scheduled by an executor.
- Threads: OS-level concurrency; async tasks are lighter and multiplexed on threads.
