## Codewars problems and their solutions in Rust

- This folder contains different problems and their solved questions from Codewars.
- This folder is just my personal notes and practice of Rust language.

For example:

- [Square Every Digit](src/bin/example-1.rs)
- [Vowel Count](src/bin/example-2.rs)
- [Ones and Zeros](src/bin/example-3.rs)
- [Replace With Alphabet Position](src/bin/example-4.rs)
