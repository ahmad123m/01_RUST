#### Data type

There are two types of data types, *Scalar* and *Compound*

random:(using parse.() will convert the string to integer)

- Scalar type
Integer, Bool, float, Char
Bools are basically more used with if else.
Chars are used with single quote instead of string""
- Compound type
Tuples and Arrays
Tuples can have multiple different types while arrays have only one type and are fixed in size.
Accessing tuple can be done by using (.) with the index to access while in arrays use a[index]
Vectors will be introduced instead of array later.
