## Functions

````rust
fn main(){
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
````
It is the most basic function.

- Functions are defined in snake case (variables also)
- Functions can pass parameters, not only one but multiple.

#### Statement and Expression

Statements are instructions that performs actions and do not return a value
Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.
Putting a semicolon will turn an expression into a statement.
So don't put ; after an expression.
For example let x =8; is a statement.

Functions can have a return value. Indicated by ->
